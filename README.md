# HarmoniAI - A RAG Chatbot

## Introduction

Hello! I'm Mourya JP, and I built this project using the **Next.js** framework along with **DataStax Astra**, **Google AI Studio**, and **LangChain**. This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** called **HarmoniAI**, designed to provide insightful and supportive responses related to mental health and well-being.

To run the development server, use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app in action.
