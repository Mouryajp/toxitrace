# ToxiTrace â€“ Multimodal Mental Well-being Assessor ðŸ§ 

## Introduction

Hi, I'm Mourya JP. I created ToxiTrace, a cutting-edge tool designed to assess mental well-being using multimodal AI techniques. It analyzes textual inputs, tone, and contextual cues to detect emotional distress, toxicity, and negative sentiment.

ToxiTrace makes mental health support more intelligent, empathetic, and proactive, and it can be integrated into various platforms and applications.

## ðŸ”„ Powered by HarmoniAI â€“ A RAG-Based Chatbot

To showcase ToxiTrace in action, I built HarmoniAI, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that integrates ToxiTrace to provide thoughtful and context-aware responses to users dealing with mental health challenges.

HarmoniAI is built using:

Next.js

LangChain

DataStax Astra

Google AI Studio

It retrieves relevant knowledge and augments it with AI-generated responses, while ToxiTrace continuously evaluates the emotional quality of interactions, enabling smarter, safer, and more supportive conversations.

## Getting Started

To run the development server, use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app in action.

### Editing
You can start editing by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you make changes.
